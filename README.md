# Cipher Vault

Cipher Vault is a web application that provides functionalities for text encryption, decryption, compression, and decompression using various ciphers. The application supports the Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, and Atbash Cipher. 

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, or Atbash Cipher.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt text using Caesar Cipher.
- **Compression**: Compress text using a basic run-length encoding technique.
- **Decompression**: Decompress text compressed by the run-length encoding technique.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Cipher Vault, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
